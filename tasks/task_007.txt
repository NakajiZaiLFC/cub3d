# Task ID: 7
# Title: Implement Player Movement and Collision Detection
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement player movement controls (WASD) with proper collision detection against walls.
# Details:
1. Implement key press detection for W, A, S, D keys
2. Calculate new player positions based on direction vector and movement speed
3. Implement collision detection to prevent walking through walls
4. Consider player size when checking for collisions
5. Ensure smooth movement by using frame time for speed calculation
6. Implement proper movement vector calculations for forward/backward and strafing
7. Add a small buffer distance from walls to prevent clipping issues

# Test Strategy:
Test player movement in various directions, ensuring the player cannot move through walls. Verify that movement speed is consistent and that collision detection works correctly at different angles.
