# Task ID: 8
# Title: Implement View Rotation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 7
# Priority: medium
# Description: Add functionality to rotate the player's view using the left and right arrow keys.
# Details:
1. Implement key press detection for left and right arrow keys
2. Create rotation matrix functions to rotate the direction vector
3. Update both the direction vector and camera plane vector during rotation
4. Ensure smooth rotation by using frame time for rotation speed
5. Implement proper vector normalization after rotation
6. Ensure the camera plane remains perpendicular to the direction vector
7. Add rotation speed constant for easy adjustment

# Test Strategy:
Test view rotation with arrow keys, ensuring smooth and consistent rotation. Verify that the view rotates correctly in both directions and that the perspective remains correct after rotation.
