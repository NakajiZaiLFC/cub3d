# Task ID: 5
# Title: Implement Texture Loading and Wall Rendering
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: high
# Description: Load wall textures from XPM files and implement textured wall rendering based on the raycasting results.
# Details:
1. Implement XPM texture loading using MiniLibX
2. Create texture data structures to store loaded textures
3. Calculate texture coordinates based on ray hit positions
4. Implement wall rendering with the appropriate texture based on wall orientation
5. Ensure textures are properly stretched/scaled according to wall distance
6. Implement texture coordinate calculation to determine which part of the texture to display
7. Optimize texture rendering for performance

# Test Strategy:
Test with different textures and verify that walls display correctly with textures corresponding to their orientation (NO, SO, WE, EA). Check for texture alignment and scaling issues.
