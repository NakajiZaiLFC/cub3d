# Task ID: 3
# Title: Implement Map Validation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Create functions to validate the map structure, ensuring it meets all requirements (surrounded by walls, single player position, etc.).
# Details:
1. Create a 2D map representation from the parsed data
2. Implement validation for map characters (0, 1, N, S, E, W)
3. Check that the map is completely surrounded by walls using flood fill algorithm
4. Validate that exactly one player starting position exists
5. Check for invalid spacing within the map
6. Implement detailed error reporting for each validation failure
7. Ensure spaces around walls are properly handled according to the requirements

# Test Strategy:
Test with various maps including valid ones, maps with holes in walls, multiple player positions, invalid characters, and problematic spacing. Verify correct validation results and error messages.
